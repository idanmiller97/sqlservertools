This file is intended to help with sqlserver performance problem solving.
I will write few details on quick performance approaches

1) Check Server hardware and sql configuration
2) When checking queries, check the tables itself, what type of table is it (row/column store, matirialized view etc)
3) Check indices on the table, if they are match to the query and if you need to add / delete some
4) Validate the data you have, verify that have time in the table (if needed and possible), relation between table and more
5) When checking query performance, check the following : check indices, check the join condition to other tables, check if there is usage of window functions and if you can avoid it
6) Try to minimize and filter data as much as you can, inspire to create ctes and filter the most data that you can.
